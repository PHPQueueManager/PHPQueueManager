# PHP Queue Manager

This library was created to easily create and manage your own job queues. This library aims to abstract the queuing mechanisms and increase scalability. You will find an application built on this library in the [PHPQueueManager/Application](https://github.com/PHPQueueManager/Application) repo.

```
composer require phpqueuemanager/php-queue-manager
```
You can find a starter project based on this package here.

### Develop Your Own Queue Storage Adapter

You can write your own Queue Storage and your own handler.

```php
<?php
namespace App\QueueManager\Adapters;

use \PHPQueueManager\PHPQueueManager\Adapters\{AbstractAdapter, AdapterInterface};
use \PHPQueueManager\PHPQueueManager\Exceptions\{DeadLetterQueueException, 
    ReTryQueueException};
use \PHPQueueManager\PHPQueueManager\Queue\{JobMessageInterface,
    Message,
    MessageInterface,
    QueueInterface};

class MyQueueAdapter extends AbstractAdapter implements AdapterInterface
{

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function connect(): bool
    {
        try {
            // TODO : Open Connection
            
            return true;
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function queueDeclare(QueueInterface $queue): self
    {
        // TODO : Queue Declare
        
        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function publish(MessageInterface $message): bool
    {
        try {
            // TODO : Add a New Job to the Queue!

            return true;
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function consume(\Closure $worker)
    {
        try {
            // TODO : Consume Queued Messages!
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        }
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function close(): bool
    {
        // TODO : Close Connection
        
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function retry(MessageInterface $message): void
    {
        $message->retryNotification();
        // TODO : Set Message to Try Again
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function addDeadLetterQueue(MessageInterface $message): void
    {
        try {
            $message->deadLetterNotification();
            // TODO : Write to Death Letter Queue.
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        }
    }

}
```
